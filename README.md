This is a game like war.

## Description
This program is a game called a game like war. This game is a card game where the user is given a initial deck and he battles enemy decks by comparing values of cards, as he beats more and more enemies the users goal is to see how long they can last battling harder and harder enemy decks. 

## GAME PLAY 
The game play consists of 2 main stages Battle and Shop. the battle is the combat of the game and the Shop is the deck building proccess of the game.

## battle
inside the battle gamplay the user starts off with a initlized deck and jumps right into a battle, the  battle sequence starts off by both the enemy deck and the users deck being shuffled and drawing 7 cards, the user then can choose to either use a battle item, or can pick a card to battle with, after the user selects a card to battle with then it is compared up against the enemies card, which ever card has the highest value wins the round, whoe ever loses a round loses health, the round will repeat until either the enemy runs out of health OR the user runs out of health, if the user runs out of health the game is over. if the enemy runs out of health then the user wins and gets a level, and currency and then goes onto the shop phase of the game

## SHOP 
after a battle the user gets currency, with this currency the user can purchase either more  cards to add to their deck, the ability to remove a card from their deck ( if they want to get rid of low value cards), purchase different battle items to be used in battle such as see what the enemy card is or heal, OR you can purchase an item that reloads the shop. after you purchae all that you want for your deck the user can type exit to go on to the next battlle
